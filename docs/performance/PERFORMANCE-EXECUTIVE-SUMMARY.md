## üö® Critical Security Issue

**MUST FIX BEFORE RELEASE**

### Issue: Broken TSS Cryptographic Operations

**Location**: `/src/crypto/tss/TSSKeyGeneration.swift`

**What's Wrong**:
```swift
// Line 456 - modularInverse returns input unchanged!
private func modularInverse(_ a: Data, ...) throws -> Data {
    return a  // ‚ùå COMPLETELY BROKEN
}

// Line 473 - Uses SHA256 instead of EC point multiplication
func secp256k1PublicKey(from privateKey: Data) throws -> Data {
    var pubKey = Data([0x02])
    pubKey.append(privateKey.sha256())  // ‚ùå NOT REAL CRYPTO
    return pubKey
}
```

**Impact**:
- ‚ùå Generated keys are cryptographically insecure
- ‚ùå Cannot generate valid Ethereum/Bitcoin addresses
- ‚ùå TSS signatures may be invalid

**Fix**: Integrate `BigInt` and `secp256k1` libraries (16 hours effort)
