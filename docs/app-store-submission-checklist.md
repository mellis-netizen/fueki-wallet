## Common Rejection Reasons & Mitigation

### Rejection: Guideline 3.2.1 - Business Model
**Reason**: App markets itself as securities platform without proper licensing

**Mitigation**:
- Rebrand marketing to emphasize "cryptocurrency wallet" not "securities platform"
- Remove phrases like "Institutional-Grade Digital Securities"
- Focus on wallet functionality, not trading/issuance

### Rejection: Guideline 5.1.1 - Data Collection
**Reason**: Missing or incomplete Privacy Manifest

**Mitigation**:
- Create comprehensive PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy file
- Accurately declare all data collection
- Ensure Privacy Policy matches declared practices

### Rejection: Guideline 2.3 - Metadata
**Reason**: Screenshots don't match actual app

**Mitigation**:
- Use actual app screenshots, not mockups
- Ensure UI shown in screenshots is implemented
- Remove any "coming soon" features from marketing

### Rejection: Guideline 4.0 - Design
**Reason**: Poor accessibility or non-native design

**Mitigation**:
- Test VoiceOver thoroughly
- Support Dynamic Type
- Follow Human Interface Guidelines
- Test on multiple device sizes
