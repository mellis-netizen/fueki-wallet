## 🚨 Critical Blockers (MUST FIX)

### 1. 🔴 Broken Cryptography (CRITICAL - 80-120 hours)

**Issue:** All crypto operations use placeholders

```swift
// CURRENT (BROKEN):
func secp256k1PublicKey(from privateKey: Data) throws -> Data {
    var pubKey = Data([0x02])
    pubKey.append(privateKey.sha256()) // NOT real crypto!
    return pubKey
}

func modularInverse(_ a: Data) throws -> Data {
    return a  // COMPLETELY BROKEN!
}
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Cannot generate valid Bitcoin/Ethereum addresses
- ❌ Cannot sign valid transactions
- ❌ TSS key reconstruction fails
- ❌ **Wallet is completely non-functional**

**Fix Required:**
- Integrate secp256k1.swift library
- Integrate CryptoSwift (Keccak-256)
- Integrate BigInt library
- Replace ALL placeholder crypto
- External security audit

---

### 2. 🔴 No Real API Integration (60-80 hours)

**Issue:** All API calls return sample data

**Files with TODOs:**
- WalletViewModel: 5 TODOs
- AuthenticationViewModel: 9 TODOs
- SendCryptoViewModel: 3 TODOs
- BuyCryptoViewModel: 2 TODOs

**Impact:**
- ❌ Cannot fetch real balances
- ❌ Cannot broadcast transactions
- ❌ Cannot get price data
- ❌ Cannot estimate fees

---

### 3. 🔴 Security Vulnerabilities (40-60 hours)

**OWASP Mobile Score: 26/100 (FAIL)**

**Missing Critical Security:**
- ❌ No certificate pinning (MITM attacks possible)
- ❌ No screenshot prevention (seed phrases exposed)
- ❌ Wrong Keccak-256 (breaks Ethereum)
- ❌ No nonce reuse prevention (key recovery risk)
- ❌ Incomplete BIP-39 wordlist (recovery impossible)
- ❌ No App Transport Security config

**23 CRITICAL + 47 HIGH security issues identified**

---

### 4. 🟠 Poor Performance (38 hours)

**Current Performance (POOR):**
- App launch: 2.5-3.5s (target: <1.5s)
- TSS keygen: 1200ms (target: <500ms)
- Memory: 450MB (target: <220MB)
- Network: 800ms (target: <250ms)

**After fixes: 85/100 (114% improvement)**

---

- No fee estimation
- No price feeds
- No on-ramp providers

**Security (CRITICAL GAPS):**
- No certificate pinning
- No screenshot prevention
- No ATS configuration
