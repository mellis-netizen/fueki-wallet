## üîê TSS Cryptography for Social Sign-On

### Primary Recommendation: **Web3Auth TSS SDK**

**Why Web3Auth?**
- ‚úÖ Native iOS Swift SDK (no bridges or FFI)
- ‚úÖ Built-in OAuth integration (Google, Apple, Facebook)
- ‚úÖ Production-proven (used by major dApps)
- ‚úÖ 2/3 threshold signature scheme
- ‚úÖ Free tier for development
- ‚úÖ 1-2 days integration time

**Key Technical Points**:
- Uses MPC (Multi-Party Computation) for distributed key generation
- Key shares distributed across: user device (Secure Enclave) + Web3Auth nodes
- No single point of failure - private key never fully reconstructed
- Supports multiple blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc.)

**Security Architecture**:
```
User Authentication ‚Üí OAuth Provider ‚Üí TSS DKG Process
                                            ‚Üì
                    Share 1 (iOS Secure Enclave) + Share 2 (Web3Auth Node 1) + Share 3 (Web3Auth Node 2)
                                            ‚Üì
                    Transaction Signing requires 2/3 threshold (user approval + 1 node)
```

**Alternatives Evaluated**:
- **Lit Protocol**: More decentralized, but React Native dependency
- **Fireblocks**: Enterprise-grade, but expensive and complex
- **ZenGo/Gotham**: Requires Rust FFI integration

## üí≥ Payment On/Off Ramp Solutions

### Primary Recommendation: **Ramp Network**

**Why Ramp Network?**
- ‚úÖ Native Swift iOS SDK (best mobile experience)
- ‚úÖ Lowest fees (0.49% for bank transfers, 2.9% for cards)
- ‚úÖ Fastest KYC (Onfido, 2-4 minutes)
- ‚úÖ Best geographic coverage (170+ countries)
- ‚úÖ Apple Pay and Google Pay support
- ‚úÖ No monthly minimums or setup fees

**Secondary Recommendation: MoonPay** (as fallback)
- More mature off-ramp product
- Higher brand recognition
- Higher fees (1-4.5%)
- Good for unsupported regions

**Hybrid Approach** (Recommended):
```
1. Check user's country/region
2. Route to Ramp Network (primary)
3. Fallback to MoonPay (if Ramp unsupported)
4. Track conversion rates and optimize routing
```

**Fee Comparison** (for $1,000 purchase):
| Provider | Card Fee | Bank Fee | Total Cost | User Receives |
|----------|----------|----------|------------|---------------|
| Ramp Network | 2.9% ($29) | 0.49% ($5) | $1,032 | ~$968 ETH |
| MoonPay | 4.5% ($45) | 1% ($10) | $1,050 | ~$945 ETH |
| Transak | 3.5% ($35) | 1% ($10) | $1,045 | ~$955 ETH |

**Supported Payment Methods**:
- Credit/debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex)
- Bank transfers (ACH, SEPA, wire)
- Apple Pay
- Google Pay
- UPI (India - Transak only)

**KYC Tiers**:
- Tier 1: Email verification ($50 limit)
- Tier 2: ID verification ($500-$2,000 limit)
- Tier 3: Enhanced verification (unlimited)

## ü™ô Crypto Wallet Standards

### Core Standards Implemented

#### **1. BIP39: Mnemonic Seed Phrases**
- 12 or 24 word recovery phrases
- 2048-word standardized wordlist
- Checksum for error detection
- PBKDF2-based seed generation

**Example**:
```
Mnemonic: "witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least"
         ‚Üì
Seed: 512-bit cryptographic seed (via PBKDF2 with 2048 iterations)
```

#### **2. BIP32: Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets**
- Generate unlimited key pairs from single seed
- Tree structure for organization
- Extended keys (xprv, xpub) for key sharing
- Hardened vs non-hardened derivation

**Example Path**:
```
m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index
m / 44'      / 0'         / 0'       / 0      / 0
```

#### **3. BIP44: Multi-Account Hierarchy**
- Standardized derivation paths for different cryptocurrencies
- Coin type registry (SLIP-0044)

**Common Paths**:
```
Bitcoin (BTC):  m/44'/0'/0'/0/0
Ethereum (ETH): m/44'/60'/0'/0/0
Solana (SOL):   m/44'/501'/0'/0/0
```

#### **4. iOS Secure Enclave Integration**
- Hardware-protected private key storage
- Biometric authentication (Face ID / Touch ID)
- Keys never leave secure hardware
- Brute-force protection

**Hybrid Approach**:
```
BIP32 seed encrypted by Secure Enclave master key
         ‚Üì
Stored in iOS Keychain (encrypted at rest)
         ‚Üì
Biometric auth required to decrypt and derive keys
         ‚Üì
Transaction signing happens in isolated memory
         ‚Üì
Keys wiped from memory immediately after use
```

### Blockchain Integration

**Recommended Multi-Chain Architecture**:
```swift
protocol BlockchainService {
    func generateAddress(from publicKey: Data) -> String
    func getBalance(for address: String) async throws -> Decimal
    func sendTransaction(...) async throws -> String
    func estimateFee(...) async throws -> Decimal
}

// Implementations:
- BitcoinService (BTC, LTC, BCH)
- EthereumService (ETH, MATIC, AVAX, ARB, OP)
- SolanaService (SOL)
```

**RPC Provider Recommendations**:
| Provider | Chains | Free Tier | Reliability |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Alchemy | ETH, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism | 300M req/month | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Infura | ETH, Polygon, IPFS | 100k req/day | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Ankr | 15+ chains | Rate-limited | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
