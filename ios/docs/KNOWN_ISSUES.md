## Critical Issues (Blocking Production) ðŸ”´

### CRIT-001: Privacy Manifest Missing
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** Open
**Impact:** App Store rejection
**Discovered:** 2025-10-21

**Description:**
iOS requires a privacy manifest file (`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`) since iOS 17.0. This file is completely missing from the project.

**Affected Components:**
- App Store submission
- iOS 17+ compliance

**Reproduction:**
```bash
ls ios/FuekiWallet/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy
# File does not exist
```

**Expected Behavior:**
Privacy manifest should exist and declare:
- Privacy-impacting APIs used
- Data collection practices
- Tracking domains (if any)

**Workaround:**
None - must be fixed for App Store submission

**Fix Required:**
Create `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` with complete privacy declarations

**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours
**Priority:** P0 (Must fix before submission)

**Related:**
- APP_STORE_SUBMISSION.md Section 2.1
- PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT.md Section 4

### CRIT-002: Debug Logging in Production Code
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** Open
**Impact:** Security risk, performance degradation
**Discovered:** 2025-10-21

**Description:**
75 instances of `print()`, `NSLog()`, or `debugPrint()` found in production source code across 22 files. These statements may:
- Expose sensitive data in device logs
- Impact performance
- Drain battery
- Leak cryptographic operations

**Affected Files:**
```
PaymentRampService.swift: 3 instances
BiometricAuthView.swift: 2 instances
WalletViewModel.swift: 1 instance
SendCryptoViewModel.swift: 2 instances
+ 18 other files
Total: 75 instances
```

**Example:**
```swift
// WRONG - in production code
print("Private key: \(privateKey)")
print("Transaction hash: \(txHash)")
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- No debug logging in production builds
- Use OSLog for production logging with proper log levels
- Sensitive data should never be logged

**Security Impact:**
Private keys, seed phrases, or transaction data could be leaked to:
- Device system logs
- Crash reports
- Debugging tools

**Workaround:**
None - must remove all debug statements

**Fix Required:**
1. Remove all `print()` statements
2. Implement OSLog framework
3. Use conditional compilation for debug builds

**Proposed Solution:**
```swift
import OSLog

extension Logger {
    static let wallet = Logger(subsystem: "com.fueki.wallet", category: "wallet")
}

// Usage
#if DEBUG
Logger.wallet.debug("Debug info: \(info)")
#endif

Logger.wallet.info("User action completed")
```

**Estimated Effort:** 3 hours
**Priority:** P0 (Security risk)

**Related:**
- PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT.md Section 2

### CRIT-003: App Store Assets Incomplete
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** Open
**Impact:** App Store submission blocked
**Discovered:** 2025-10-21

**Description:**
Required App Store assets are missing or incomplete:
- App icons may be incomplete (only AppIcon.appiconset found)
- No screenshots for App Store listing
- No app description prepared
- No keywords defined

**Missing Assets:**
1. App Store screenshots (5 required sizes)
2. App icon verification (all sizes)
3. Marketing materials
4. App preview video (optional but recommended)

**Impact:**
Cannot complete App Store Connect listing

**Workaround:**
None - required for submission

**Fix Required:**
Generate all required assets per App Store guidelines

**Estimated Effort:** 8 hours
**Priority:** P0 (Blocks submission)

**Related:**
- APP_STORE_SUBMISSION.md Section 1.4

### CRIT-004: Production Code Signing Not Configured
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** Open
**Impact:** Cannot create App Store build
**Discovered:** 2025-10-21

**Description:**
Current build configuration uses development signing:
```
CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = Apple Development
aps-environment = development
```

Production builds require:
```
CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = Apple Distribution
aps-environment = production
```

**Affected Components:**
- App Store archive creation
- Push notifications
- Production deployment

**Workaround:**
Continue using development builds (not for App Store)

**Fix Required:**
1. Create production provisioning profiles
2. Configure distribution certificates
3. Update entitlements for production
4. Test archive creation

**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours
**Priority:** P0 (Required for production)

**Related:**
- APP_STORE_SUBMISSION.md Section 2.4

## High Priority Issues (Should Fix) ðŸŸ 

### HIGH-001: SwiftLint Not Configured
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** Open
**Impact:** Code quality, maintainability
**Discovered:** 2025-10-21

**Description:**
SwiftLint is not installed or configured in the build environment. Configuration file exists (`.swiftlint.yml`) but linter is not running.

**Current State:**
```bash
swiftlint lint
# command not found: swiftlint
```

**Impact:**
- No automated code style enforcement
- Potential style inconsistencies
- No automated best practice checks

**Workaround:**
Manual code review

**Fix Required:**
```bash
# Install SwiftLint
brew install swiftlint

# Add to Xcode build phase
# Run Script Phase:
if which swiftlint >/dev/null; then
  swiftlint
else
  echo "warning: SwiftLint not installed"
fi
```

**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour
**Priority:** P1

### HIGH-004: Marketing Version Not Set
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** Open
**Impact:** Build configuration, App Store metadata
**Discovered:** 2025-10-21

**Description:**
`MARKETING_VERSION` is not explicitly set in project settings, relying on variable substitution:
```xml
<key>CFBundleShortVersionString</key>
<string>$(MARKETING_VERSION)</string>
```

**Expected:**
Explicit version in build settings:
```
MARKETING_VERSION = 1.0.0
CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION = 1
```

**Impact:**
- Version string may be undefined
- App Store Connect may reject upload
- TestFlight builds unclear

**Workaround:**
Set manually in Xcode before archive

**Fix Required:**
Set explicit version numbers in project settings

**Estimated Effort:** 15 minutes
**Priority:** P1

        // Optionally restrict features
    }
}
```

**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours
**Priority:** P2
